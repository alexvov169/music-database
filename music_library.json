Hip hop began in the Bronx in New York City in the 1970s, primarily among African Americans and Jamaican Americans, with some Latino influences.\n\nThe term rap is often used synonymously with hip hop, but hip hop denotes the practices of an entire subculture. Hip hop arose when DJs began isolating the percussion break from funk or disco songs for audiences to dance to. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/hip+hop\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."

Rapping itself, also known as emceeing, MCing, spitting, or just rhyming, is the rhythmic spoken delivery of rhymes and wordplay. Rapping is one of the four pillars of the hip hop culture, along with DJing, graffiti, and breaking.\n\nRap is also considered a separate genre from hip hop in some cases where the artists do not make music compatible with the hip hop culture. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/tag/rap\">Read more on Last.fm</a>."
